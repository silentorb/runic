## Runic Parser ##

Created by Christopher W. Johnson

Runic is a Lexer and PEG Parser for C#.  It is not a parser generator, nor does it involve embedded code.  
Instead it loads grammars at runtime and outputs data structures that can then be processed by custom C# code.

Runic was originally created for MetaHub and Imp.
